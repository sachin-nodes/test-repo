## Project Description

Briefly describe the app, its purpose, and the main Next.js features used (for example: App Router or Pages Router, server components, API routes, ISR/SSR/SSG usage, TypeScript).

## Getting Started (Next.js)

Prerequisites

- Git
- Node.js (recommended LTS version, e.g. 18.x or newer)
- npm (or yarn / pnpm) — commands below use npm; replace with your package manager as appropriate

Clone and install

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
npm install
```

Local development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Build for production

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

Helpful commands (may vary by project)

- npm run dev — start development server with Fast Refresh
- npm run build — create an optimized production build
- npm run start — run the production server
- npm run lint — run ESLint
- npm run format — run Prettier (if configured)
- npm run test — run tests (if configured)

If the project uses TypeScript, ensure types are installed and configured. Common script names can differ; consult package.json for exact scripts.

## Development Commands

- Start dev server: npm run dev
- Build: npm run build
- Start production server: npm run start
- Lint: npm run lint
- Type-check: npm run type-check (if available)
- Test: npm run test

## Project Structure

A typical Next.js project layout (adjust to match this repository):

```
├── public/               # Static files served from root
├── src/                  # Application source (optional)
│   ├── app/ or pages/    # App Router (app/) or Pages Router (pages/)
│   ├── components/       # Reusable React components
│   ├── styles/           # CSS/SCSS modules and global styles
│   ├── lib/              # Utilities and client/server helpers
│   └── pages/api/        # API routes (if using Pages Router)
├── next.config.js        # Next.js configuration
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json         # If TypeScript is used
└── .env.example          # Example environment variables
```

Notes:
- This project may use the App Router (app/) or the Pages Router (pages/). See the codebase root for which one is present and follow that pattern.
- Keep components small and focused. Prefer server components for data fetching where appropriate (if using the App Router).

## Configuration and Environment

Environment files

- .env.local — local development secrets (do not commit)
- .env.development — development variables
- .env.production — production variables

Environment variable conventions

- Preface public variables with NEXT_PUBLIC_ to expose them to client-side code.
- Keep secrets and private keys out of the repo.

next.config.js

Common settings you may find or configure in next.config.js:

- images.domains — allowed remote image domains
- i18n — internationalization settings
- rewrites / redirects — custom routing rules
- experimental settings or feature flags

Examples

```js
module.exports = {
  images: { domains: ['example.com'] },
  reactStrictMode: true,
  rewrites: async () => [
    { source: '/api/:path*', destination: '/api/:path*' }
  ]
}
```

Secrets and deployment variables

Ensure required environment variables are documented in `.env.example` and configured in your deployment provider (Vercel, Netlify, etc.).

## Routing and Data Fetching

- App Router (app/): file-system based routing with nested layouts and server components.
- Pages Router (pages/): pages/ and API routes under pages/api/.

Data fetching strategies

- Server-side Rendering (getServerSideProps or server components)
- Static Generation (getStaticProps / getStaticPaths)
- Incremental Static Regeneration (revalidate)

Refer to the code for which strategies are used in each route.

## Styling and Assets

- Global styles typically live in styles/globals.css or similar
- Component styles often use CSS Modules (component.module.css) or a CSS-in-JS solution
- Images and static assets go in the public/ directory

If the project uses Tailwind CSS, PostCSS, or Sass, configuration files (tailwind.config.js, postcss.config.js, .scss files) will be present.

## Testing and Linting

- Linting: ESLint configuration is typically in .eslintrc.js or package.json.
- Formatting: Prettier configuration may live in .prettierrc or package.json.
- Testing: Jest and React Testing Library are common; run with npm run test if configured.

Add or update tests for new features and run linters before opening pull requests.

## Deployment

Recommended: Vercel (first-party Next.js platform)

Quick Vercel steps

1. Sign in to Vercel and import the Git repository.
2. Ensure the Root is set to the repository root (unless the app lives in a subfolder).
3. Set Environment Variables in the Vercel dashboard to match `.env.production`.
4. Build command: npm run build
5. Output directory: leave default (Next.js manages .next)

Other options

- Static export (`next export`) for fully static sites (no server-rendered features).
- Docker: build a production image with Node and run the compiled app.
- GitHub Actions: use the Vercel action or run build/test steps and deploy artifacts to your provider.

Deployment notes

- For serverless or edge deployments, review API route compatibility and any Node APIs used in server code.
- Verify image optimization settings and remote domains in production.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch: git checkout -b feature/your-feature
3. Implement your changes, add tests, and run linters.
4. Open a pull request describing your changes.

Code style

- Follow the established code style in the repo.
- Run linting and formatting before submitting PRs.
